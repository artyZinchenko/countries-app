Countries App

A simple react app that helps you search basic information about any country.

It is a training project and it utilizes functional search bar and Weather Api that uploads current weather at coutry capital. App gets countries data from https://restcountries.com/.

WeatherAPI key is naturally missing in this repo.

Code requires refactoring which is postponed due to my occupation with bigger training projects.
